# Repository Guidelines

## Project Overview

## Agent Notes

### When Using AI Agents
1. **Follow CLAUDE.md** - It defines repository-specific workflow expectations
2. **Respect atomic operations** - Never bypass the temp→validate→backup→rename pattern
3. **Maintain data integrity** - Always validate before and after operations
4. **Use proper testing** - Add tests for new features and bug fixes
5. **Follow commit conventions** - Use proper types and scopes
6. **No time estimates** - Focus on scope and complexity instead

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't edit JSON files directly - use CLI commands only
- Don't skip validation steps - they're critical for data integrity
- Don't add time estimates - they're explicitly prohibited
- Don't forget atomic operations - all writes must be atomic
